# PSO-A2C-Lnet
PSO-A2C-Lnet is a collaborative project developed by myself and [P.K. Quansah](link-to-paper). This framework is designed for short-term load forecasting and is built upon a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It also incorporates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimizing model hyperparameters. Our research has been published in the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing, and you can access the paper [here](link-to-paper). (In Press atm - to be updated soon)

## Datasets
This repository contains the following datasets:

1. **Panama Dataset**:
   - Includes historical load data, a comprehensive set of weather variables, information on holidays, and historical load weekly forecast features.

2. **Ercot Dataset**:
   - Hourly load data specifically focused on Texas.

3. **Rte Dataset**:

  ## Implementation

The core implementation is provided in an IPython Notebook (`ipynb_file.ipynb`). In this notebook, you will find Python code that implements the hybrid CNN-LSTM model for short-term load forecasting. The unique feature of this framework is the use of Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize the model's hyperparameters, enhancing its predictive performance.

## Testing

We have tested the PSO-A2C-Lnet framework on the following datasets:

1. Panama Dataset
2. Ercot Dataset
3. Rte Dataset

These tests ensure the generalizability and robustness of our framework across different datasets.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge Prof. P.Y. Okyere's guidance in this endeavour.
